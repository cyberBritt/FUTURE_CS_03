# 🔐 Secure File Sharing System

## 📄 Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world solution where users can upload and download files securely using AES encryption. The goal is to protect files both at rest and during transit. It was developed using Python Flask (or optionally Node.js) and incorporates encryption best practices, a simple web interface, and secure key management.

This type of system is useful in environments like healthcare, legal, or corporate settings where sensitive data transfer must be protected.

## 🔍 Sample Analysis Insights

- 🔐 **Encryption in Action**: Files are encrypted before storing using AES and only decrypted on download
- 📂 **Secure File Handling**: Uploads and downloads are validated and tracked
- 🧪 **API Security**: Tested endpoints using Postman and curl for verification
- 🗝️ **No Plaintext Keys**: Encryption keys are generated and stored securely
- 👤 **Simplicity for Users**: Interface designed for intuitive use
